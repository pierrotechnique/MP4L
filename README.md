# Modular Polyphony for Live [![License: LGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-LGPL%20v3-blue.svg)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0)

This library contains the building blocks for the MP4L modular polyphonic synthesis control system in Max for Live (® Ableton), based on the Modular Polyphony Max (® Cycling ’74) library.

This code is under GNU-LGPL licence which can be read in the LICENSE file.

This is entirely under construction for the moment so use and explore at your own risk. The final product will be encapsulated in the MP4L.amxd Max for Live device.

## Usage
Download or clone this repository and put it in your Max package folder.

Open /examples/mp4l.chordgenPush.maxpat for a first look at a functional module (set up for a Push at the moment, more control options coming soon).

## Credits
